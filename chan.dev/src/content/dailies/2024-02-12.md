Intercom cold:

```
Hi! My name is Michael Chan. I'm interested in pitching your team on a content partnership on the topic of visual testing.  
  
I have a series of talks, workshops, and drip campaigns around Storybook. And I'm looking for service partners to demonstrate the power of Visual Testing for teams.  
  
Who might be the best person to talk with about this?  
  
Thanks,  
  
Michael
```

Followed up via email:

```
HiÂ ðŸ‘‹

I'm following up after a briefÂ conversationÂ with Shadaab in support chat.

I'm delivering quite a bit of Storybook content (talks, workshops, and videoÂ education,Â and drip campaigns) in 2024. And I'm looking for content sponsors for the visual testing sections.

I'm planning to pick up whereÂ I left off in myÂ [Storybook 7 course (which uses Chromatic)](https://egghead.io/courses/a-beginner-s-guide-to-storybook-7-with-react-56f61ecf?af=1x80ad)Â and showcase visual testing with Storybook.

I'd love to know if you've done partnershipsÂ like this in theÂ past and see if we may be a good fit.

Thanks for your interest,

Michael
