- I got laid off. And I'm excited about it.
- But first: I'd love your help:
  1. If you think I'd be a good addition to your team, send me a link
  2. If I've helped you on your developer journey, send me a tweet-testemonial
     - In developer education work, these go a really lang way
- So why am I excited?
  - I've never executed a job search in public before
  - And I'm excited to do it more openly this month
  - If you're looking for a job, or think you might be, follow along to see how I tackle it
- I'm also excited because I learned something
  - I got fired for the right reason this time
  - And that's evidenced by all the feedback I got from Chromatic leadership on exit:
  - I did an excellent job. We just had different ideas on how to get there.
  - And I'm good with that. I left nothing on the field.
- It's gonna be one helluvah march
- See ya in there
