When we show deferred values, it's important to communicate to users that the view is "stale".

We can accomplish this by comparing our current state with the deferred state.

```js
let isStale = deferredSearchTerm !== searchTerm
```

When these values don't match, the view is stale. And we can update the UI to communicate that visually. In this illustration, I change the opacity of the content while stale.

![GIF showing a piece of UI with an input and several thousand paragrah tags that mirror that input. The p tags lag behind the input because they `useDeferredValue`. While they are out of sync, the opacity is reduced significantly. They then return to full opacity once they've caught up to the input.](./2021-input-with-usedeferredvalue-and-isstale.gif)
