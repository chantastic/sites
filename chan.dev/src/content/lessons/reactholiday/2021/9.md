title: "#9: Opt in to automatic batching with createRoot"

When we update to the _new root API_ (`createRoot`), we get performance improvements out-of-the-box.

Neat!

Automatic batching is a performance improvement that reduces `useState` re-renders.
Imagine an event handler that updates two pieces of state, `count` and `isOdd`.

```jsx
function handleClick() {
  updateCount((count) => count + 1);
  updateIsOdd((isOdd) => !isOdd);
  // only one re-render
}
```

These state updates are batched and result in one re-render. But that changes if we call those updater functions outside of this function (think asynchronous `fetch`).

When we call updater functions outside of handler functions, we lose batching. Look at this slight alteration below where we wrap updater functions in a setTimeout.

These updates will not be batched.

```jsx
function handleClick() {
setTimeout(() =>
updateCount(count => count + 1);
updateIsOdd(isOdd => !isOdd);
, 0)
// one re-render per update
}
```

This is both a permormance issue and and expectation problem.

Fortunately, React 18 fixes this. Now, `useState` updater functions are automatically batched — no matter where they are called.

P.S.  
Because React 18 automatically batches all updates, you can safely remove `unstable_batchedUpdates`. With the _new root API_, this function is a no-op.
