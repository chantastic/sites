title: '#19: What have we learned this week?'

This week we learned that [Concurrent 'mode' is dead](https://react.holiday/2021/13),
that [transitions help us improve user experience for slow views](https://react.holiday/2021/14), and when to choose [`useTransition`](https://react.holiday/2021/16) over [`startTransition`](https://react.holiday/2021/15).

I'd like to test your knowledge with a few questions:

1. If there is no bottom-up "Concurrent Mode" for React, which parts of a React 18 application use concurrent rendering?
1. What types of user experiences do transitions help us improve?
1. What additional insight does `useTransition` give us that `startTransition` does not?
1. What is the order of elements returned from `useTransition`?

If you feel like you didn't catch everything, review all the lessons at [react.holiday/2021](https://react.holiday/2021). Or re-watch [this week's video recap](https://youtu.be/Kd0d-9RQHSw).

P.S.  
This week is filled with new concepts.  
If you're having trouble, hit reply and let me know how I can help!

**Answers:**

1. The parts of a React 18 application that utilize concurrent rendernig are the component trees that use concurrent features like `startTransition`, `useTransition`, and `getDeferredValue`.
1. Transitions help us improve user experience when updates are slow. Transitions are useful for both slow networks and expensive computations.
1. A boolean with the state of the transition.
1. [`isPending <boolean>`, `startTransition <function>`]
