You've made it thru week one!

In these first three lessons you've learned about React 18's [gradual adoption strategy](https://react.holiday/2021/1), [what each version tag means](https://react.holiday/2021/2), and how to [use the new root API](https://react.holiday/2021/3).

It's been an eventful three days!

Before we start migrating your app, I want to make sure you understand everything we've covered. So I've recapped it all into a 9 minute code-along YouTube video.

Pay close attention because tomorrow there's a test 😊.
