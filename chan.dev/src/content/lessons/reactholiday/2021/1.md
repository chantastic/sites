React 18 has done something amazing.

If you install React 18, right now, and change no code, your app will work exactly as it does on React 17.

The only change you'll see is a development-only console message warning that you are in a compatibility mode.

React Core calls this their gradual adoption strategy. And it has powerful implications. It empowers us and strategically adopt the new features and performance improvements of React 18 selectively. We can enable it by route, by environment, or even subset of users. And we'll cover how in these first two weeks.

Take a moment to look up the React package on npm.
Tomorrow, we'll talk about versions and what they mean.
