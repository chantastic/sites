title: '#10: Opt out of automatic batching with ReactDOM.flushSync'

Automatic batching of state update is a great improvement in React 18.

But even performances improvements — like this — create an opportunity for bugs. There's a chance that our app might rely on non-batched updates unintentionally.

So when we see batching bugs, there's a quick way to back into the old behavior and continue our migration: `ReactDOM.flushSync`.

This method wraps state updates to force a re-render. It looks like this:

```jsx
ReactDOM.flushSync(() =>
	updateCount(c => c + 1);
)
```

This is a bandaid.
It's a great way to patch up a bug. But it's always better to root out batching bugs and update the code to allow for the faster, more consistent default of automatic batching.
