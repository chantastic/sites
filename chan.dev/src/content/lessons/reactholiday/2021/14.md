React 18 is openning new capabilities. And new capabilities come with new language.

The most important new term in React 18 is **"transition"**. And I want to make sure we understand what transitions are before diving into code.

A **transition** is a classification of update.

Today, all updates are _urgent updates_. Expensive updates can block UI that users expect to be responsive — clicks, presses, keyboard input, etc.

In React 18, _*transition* updates_ allow us to make updates interruptible. These interruptible updates are deprioritized to make way for _urgent updates_.

Consider this isolated example from the [React Working group](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/41):

```js
// Urgent update
setInputValue(input);

// Transition update
startTransition(() => {
  setSearchQuery(input);
});
```

`setInputValue` must be set immediately to keep UI responsive.
But `setSearchQuery` can be interrupted and executed after _urgent updates_.

For the first time, React developers have a framework solution to de-prioritize low-priority updates.
