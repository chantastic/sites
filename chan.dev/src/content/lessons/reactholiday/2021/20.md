Transitions are orchestrated thru state hooks.  
They _only_ work when paired with hooks like `useState` and `useReducer`.

When using transitions with data-fetching, there are four key components:

1. The fetch request
2. The suspense-fetch wrapper (to communicate with boundaries)
3. The state updater
4. The transition

In psuedo-code, they are composed like this:

```js
transition(() => stateUpdater(() => suspenseWrapper(() => fetch())));
```

When creating abstractions, you can split on any of these function lines but all calls must be in place for the transition effect.

Open [today's StackBlitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-jj5tqo) to see what happens when you remove the state updater.  
If you're feeling bold, extract the button as its own component while keeping the same transition effect.
