We're week through week three!

This week we learned about our first current features `startTransition`, `useTransition`, and how they concurrent features replace concurrent 'mode'.

I want you to see the new interaction capabilities of concurrent mode. So I've recapped it all into a 13 minute code-along YouTube video.

The [video is here](https://youtu.be/Kd0d-9RQHSw) and [StackBlitz playground here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-kyt8pm).

Pay close attention because tomorrow there's a little test 😊
