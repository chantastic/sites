- Now I want to show you how to bring this into a project of your own…
- generate a Next.js app
- add storybook with `npx storybook@latest init`
  - (we'll change that version to `npx storybook@7.6 init, if want 7.0 — using everything you've learned here`)
- observe the intergation (specifically notes)
- show [blog post detailing what was included](https://storybook.js.org/blog/integrate-nextjs-and-storybook-automatically/)
