this question is how you invite feedback.

asking someone "what do you think?" leaves them with risk. they have to make a call on the type of feedback you're looking for and how it'll land if they pick incorrectly.

better to answer that question in the question "hey, something isn't landing here and i'm not sure what it is. i'm hoping you can identify it. and because i don't know what it is, anything is helpful."
