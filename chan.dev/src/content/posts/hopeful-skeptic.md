long-term hopeful, short term skeptic

this plays into a tweet that i made the other day

https://twitter.com/chantastic/status/1428390363518017539

> i’m not sure how it’s possible to have off-the-charts confidence and in-the-dumps self-esteem at the same time… but, here I be for 38 years

it all ties into then notion that i am very confident in an inevitable future where i have overcome. but i am overwhelmed by the losses it will take ti get there and the fool i might make of myself along the way
