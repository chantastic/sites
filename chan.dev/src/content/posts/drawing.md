## Drawing Gear

I'm no artist but I like [telling stories](https://www.instagram.com/chantastic/) and [writing notes](http://chantastic.io/2015-reactjs-conf).
These are the pens, pencils, and brushes that have become my favs.

## Pencil

[Uni-Ball KuruToga 0.5mm Mechanical Pencil](https://amzn.to/2TOMzUa)
I like mechanical pencils. This one's wircutter recommended.

## Pen

[Sakuru 6-piece Pigma Micron Ink Pen](https://amzn.to/2TOEcIg)
These pigment liners are cheap and black AF.

## Brush

[Tombow Dual Brush Pen Art Marker, N15 â€” Black](https://amzn.to/2WXGnvn)
A little shading can cover a multitude of sins.
These brushes gave me the confidence to start sharing my silly drawings. It finishes things up nicely.
Most brushes of this type are alcohol-based. This makes them more versatile but requires special paper. These are water-based. So you can use them with regular paper.
They have a set too: [Grayscale, 10-pack](https://amzn.to/2E94a44)

## Bag

[TOPO Accessory Bag (small)](http://topodesigns.com/collections/accessories/products/accessory-bags?variant=29133844423)
I love these bags. I use them for everything.
