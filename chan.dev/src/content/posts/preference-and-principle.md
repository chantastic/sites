Most people don't understand what I'm saying when I talk.

It's not their fault.
It's mine.

Some people get it — those are my closest friends.
But those who don't never come around.

But I've been trying really hard to figure out why.

i’m trying to understand what the wavelengths are and why they miss.
and i think it’s that these conversations are largely seen as a group expression of preference.
no one preference has more weight than another.
what it never is (my wavelength) is a evaluation of system.
what are the goals, what are the constraints, how do newly discovered constraints impact previous goals…

there’s no real communicating out of that.
because no matter what i say, it’s read as a preference.
“so you _don’t like_ avatars? oh now you _like_ avatars but _don’t like_ customizable colors? you just have to hate something don’t you?”
