A handful of things I learned [producing the ERC edits](https://youtu.be/oqBAFxzzsDE?si=6RGYJxzlc1qe1fa6).

# Rules for Content

- consistent content experience
  - remove time references
  - presentation (preparation + motivation)
  - keep live demo feel
  - sonic signature where possible
  - visual metaphore to reinforce
