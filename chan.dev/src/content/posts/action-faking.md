Story: The time at Jeremy’s wedding when his mother said i looked very busy, like i knew exactly what to do. And I said, the trick around the Roths is to be active. Don’t think too much about what the next action is. Just keep moving quickly.

How this is good if you want to fly under the radar but for productivity.
