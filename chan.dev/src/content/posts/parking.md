About how my dad would drive around for 15 minutes, passing parking spaces to get a “chan parking” spot, that one in a million spot up front.

Also driving aronud for gas

It created in me a deep, abiding hatred for cleverness

!!! I’ve long recognized that the things you hate in others are the thinsg you hate in you.
But sometimes the things you hate in others ARE others in you.
