About the guy in front of target who just played one song all day on the accordian and i wouldn’t have noticed if i didn’t have to make 3 trips to Target that day.

About how you can be “the auld lang syne guy” with just a few chords

And live yoru movie fantasize about being the person who plays the piano for the song everyone is swaying and singing to

and you don’t have to know the piano
