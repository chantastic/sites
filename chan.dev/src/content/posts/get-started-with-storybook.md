  # 3 ways to GET STARTED with Storybook FAST
  It's never been easier to get started with component-driven development!
  Let explore three ways that you can start building component-driven UIs in seconds with Storybook.

  ## 1. storybook.new
  Sometimes, I like spiking out a component component concept in an online sandbox first. And, thanks to StackBlitz, I can do this in Storybook!

  - Visit storybook.new
  - Select your library, builder, and language
    - I like React, Vite, and TypeScript
  - And start coding!

  This is the best place to go thru our tutorials.
  And explore new features.

  Of course, we have options if you don't like online sandboxes too…

  ## 2. npx storybook sandbox

  If you want to spin up a new Storybook, using your favorite framework, you can use the `storybook sandbox` command.

  This works exactly like the StackBlitz sandboxes — but on your local machine. We're given the option to select ui library, builder, and framework. And once we do, we can start building with the `yarn storybook` command.

  Note this is how the Storybook team tests framework integrations.

  ## 3. npx storybook new

  When it's time to go primetime and integrate Storybook into your stack, use `npx storybook new`. This command must be run inside of an existing Framework (like Next, Angular, on SvelteKit). And when it runs, it will automatically configure Storybook for your project.

  ## Outcome

  Now you know 3 ways to explore component-driven development in Storybook. Whether it be to spike out a quick component design locally or to share.
