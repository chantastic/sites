jeff Bezos is often attributed with the phrase “disagree and commit”. I hate that phrase.

I hate it because I worked at a company that weaponizes it. It became “ok, werner done talking now shut up and do what i say”

commitment was a think that was supposed to happen in an instant as soon as the manager had enough disagreeing.

“disagree and commit”, when i saw it, became “disagree and commit… then start back-channeling.” it breads a politically hostile environment because

a term i like much better is “fight. then unite” it’s admittedly more aggressive sounding — fighting and all — but it’s hard to say “it’s time to unite” and not recognize that it’s the start of another process.
