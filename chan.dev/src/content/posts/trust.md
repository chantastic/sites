the most important thing in my life is trust

not trust that i will never fuck up

but trust that i will show up for the cleanup, after i fuck up

but i realized something this year…

i wasn’t trusting others to trust me

i was playing it safe — always in bounds

that isn’t how trust works

you don’t have trust if you never exercise trust
