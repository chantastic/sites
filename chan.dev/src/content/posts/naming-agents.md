Kings direct.  
They don't instruct.

"Jester, play me a tune."  
"Servant, prepare me for battle."

They know *how* to do their job.  
And wait for the *when*.

Name classes (and modules) like agents.

"This is my *User Registrar*, it manages registrations."  
"This is my *Guitar Tech*, it manages guitars."

This keeps agents extensible.  
Because they may gain several capabilities that are not directly related to their responsibility.  

The "erer" suffix is a strong symptom of micro-management.  
*user registerer* is a task, not an agent.
