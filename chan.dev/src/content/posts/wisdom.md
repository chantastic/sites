"Passing on wisdom" was a big topic this holiday break.  
My Boomer in-laws and laws are feeling the weight of their clocks.  
And I'm feeling annoyed — for two reasons.

1. They had 23 years (I'm a late bloomer)
1. I'm not sure they accumulated much (wisdom)

That second is more global.
So let's push that one.

Our parents weren't set up to accumulate wisdom.
Knowledge, sure.
They had the largest, bound encyclopedias of all the generations.

But they're context windows were small.  
Like really, really small.

In our 90's Christian circles, churches of fewer than 100 people would violently split their only communities over which translation of the same Holy Bible was "actually the word of God." And, honestly, probably lesser infractions — like drums.

Self-righteous and evasive,
they're most rehearsed experience is the ability to globalize any fear, frustration, or fantasy, as fact.  

But wisdom the *broad* application of knowledge and experience?  
So how could such restricted experiences blossom into generational wisdom?

Anyway…

What's to learn?  
How do I do it different? Better.

First, use the time I've got.  
The wisdom I pass is the life we lived together.
All bets are off after that.

Second, embrace reality.  
The wisdom I gain isn't better than its worst application.
The experience of our parents expired quickly because it wasn't exposed to broad test cases.

They evaded and dismissed reality.  
And, doing so, *passed* on wisdom.
