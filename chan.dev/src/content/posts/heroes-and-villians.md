"you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"

- "â€¦or realize that you are always both."
- Tom Brady, quiting to late
- "Hitler wanted to be an artist"
- Pre and post Disney Marvel
- loving a principled life and letting the chips fall where they may
- if you are being truly yourself, shouldn't, mathematically, 50% of people hate you at my given moment
- where people lose is when they can no longer see themselves from another perspective. that's what important to keep, your humanit. humility, an accurate sense of self. that you're in on the joke
