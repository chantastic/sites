Job 37:13 — “whether for correction or for his land or for love, he causes it to happen”

- "cruelty." it's one of the top most common reasons to not believe in god
- take science out because, nobody knows the fuck where e came from and the hardest thing to justify is God's cruelty
- ruby, top 3 things i love on this planet
- so when she’s screaming at me ‘i don’t want ot do it!” and i’m holding her arms down, i being cruel. but it’s “for love”

take a look at Job. not only is god orchestrating his pain but literally caludijg with the devil
"god is cruel" but what does that mean, why?
