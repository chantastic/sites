- Dehancing
- perfection — turns out — is uncanny
- an image can look TOO good (as to look unintentional)
- there is a human part of us that _wants_ memories to feel dehanced from reality
- also, we don’t experince life thru perfection but the lossy instrument of our senses and unclear memories. everything comes back to us as a dream
- ever tool should be used to promote the _feeling_ of a moment. motion, light, bokeh, etc.
- [[write: every image is a lie]]
- it is a lie to provoke feeling + experience
