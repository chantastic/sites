title: Perfect Conference Video Layout

Back in 2021 the [React](https://react.dev/community/team) team put together a great online event.

They used a layout that that I've used to style conference content for [Storybook][Storybook Day] and [WorkOS]().

I finally got smart and broke it down into repeatable, mathematical template.

This is how I broke it downâ€¦

- Layout forms a 10x10 grid
- Content is scaled down to 70%, by height

Here are the dimensions (in grid unites):

```
[1.5] Title
[7  ] Content
  [3] Speaker | [7] Content
[1.5] Speaker and conf deets
```

For the [Storybook Day][] conference, we found that a dark background was least distracting.

We also added a thematic border, for a nice transition to bright content.

~12px pixels of height works well for the border (taken from the header and footer dimensions).

Finally, use a monochromatic logo, if you don't have full control over presentation styling.

I'm working on how best to set this up in DaVinci Resolve.

Here are the parts I'm working with so far:

- Fusion Clip
  - Merge clips
    - Layout image as background (to set size)
    - Presentation source
      - scaled to .7x
      - transformed to match right edge
    - Speaker source @ .7x
      - scaled to .7x
      - cropped to .3x width (centered)
      - transformed to match left edge
