we over index on “communication of the variable” and not enough on its expressiveness in a statement

!isValid

vs a natural expression using language equivalents

=== (is) ! (not) valid

what confuses this is event handlers, which (if anything) has a right to imply type — as the only parts of an app empowered to change it.

in many cases it requires a prefix to disambiguate it from state:

handleOpen() / open

open() / isOpen

but both sides don’t need to change
