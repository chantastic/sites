# Building a YouTube to SRT Converter

As a developer always on the lookout for new tools to enhance productivity, I recently took Cursor AI for a spin. This AI-powered code editor promised to streamline the coding process, so I decided to put it to the test by building a Python script to convert YouTube videos to SRT transcripts.

## The Good

Cursor AI impressed me with its ability to generate code based on natural language prompts. With a simple description of my project goals, it produced a basic script structure that I could build upon. The AI assistant was particularly helpful in providing explanations and suggestions throughout the development process.

## The Challenges

However, the journey wasn't without its hurdles. The initial setup and navigation of Cursor AI's interface took some getting used to. I found myself occasionally confused by certain features and had to experiment to understand how to effectively use commands like `Command K` for prompting and editing, and `Command Shift L` for focusing the AI on specific code snippets.

## The Learning Curve

As I progressed, I tackled tasks like setting up a virtual environment, managing dependencies, and initializing version control. While Cursor AI provided guidance, I still needed to apply my developer knowledge to ensure best practices were followed.

## The Outcome

By the end of my session, I had a functional Python script that could take a YouTube URL and generate an SRT transcript. More importantly, I had gained valuable insights into how AI can be integrated into the coding workflow.

## Final Thoughts

While Cursor AI streamlined parts of the development process, it's clear that it's not a magic solution. It's a powerful tool that, when used effectively, can enhance a developer's capabilities. However, it still requires a solid understanding of programming concepts and best practices.

As I continue to explore AI-assisted coding throughout September, I'm excited to see how tools like Cursor AI will shape the future of software development. Stay tuned for more adventures in AI-powered coding!
