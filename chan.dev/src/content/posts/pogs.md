Growing up, we had a family chiropractor.  
He was the crook type.  
As such, he found my analytical tone to be distinctly "negative" â€” classic scammer.  

He bet me 30 pogs I "couldn't be positive for a single week between our appointments."

I won, of course, but that stupid bitch gave me 30 pogs with his business logo printed on them.

Fuck him.
