## Context

I've only really been using Raycast for 2 weeks.
But I used it as a calendar event launcher for years. lol

## Calendar

- Next event hoisting
- [Create Quick Event](https://www.raycast.com/mblode/quick-event/commands)

## Quicklinks

As a launcher, I love that you can use it for launching web apps.

- [Lose It!](https://www.loseit.com/)
- [DIM](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/4611686018501985403/d2/inventory)

This is great for getting out of that cycle where you get used to typing part of a domain in a search bar. But then you visit another domain with a similar name, and that starts getting prioritized. Quicklink for anything I go to a lot.

And I can also set the exact page I want.

I launch all my electron apps into the web browser.

- [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me)

And when working with Arc (Browser), we can use [Air Traffic Control](https://resources.arc.net/hc/en-us/articles/19228064149143-Spaces-Distinct-Browsing-Areas#howtosetuparoute) to open the correct spaces and profiles:

- `Slack | personal`
- `Slack | chromatic` (opens in my chromatic space and profile)

![Arc Air Traffic Control routes setup](./whats-in-my-raycast/whats-in-my-raycast.png)

Now something I love about Raycast is how easy and discoverable everything is to manage with keyboard shortcuts.

Like, Chromatic just laid off it's OSS DX team. So, I can delete this one üòÖ

<kbd>‚åò k</kbd>
<kbd>^ x</kbd>

### VS Code workspaces

- .dotfiles
- chan.dev
- chan.dev/content

- netlify/deploys

LOVE that it's so easy to duplicate a command from the keyboard.

"Open with‚Ä¶" option

## Snippets

I use snippets for structured text formats.
I don't have much going on but I use for expense reports a lot ‚Äî where a specific format is required.

- `wellness stipend` (uses new variables)

Auto-expanding snippets.

- `@@`

## Emoji

- [Unregister emoji shortcut](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/15j3pza/comment/juxx8ib/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Absolutely chaotic that this has to be done.
- Love that you can grab the unicode character.

## Other

- [Navigator/Menu Item Search](https://www.raycast.com/changelog/1-20-0).
- Download video.
- `mdn` + tab `{search_term}`
- Change Display Mode. For changing my main display from 5k to 4k (recording).
- clipboard history
- open camera

## Some ideas

- Create a new extension for getting a VS Code url for a file path. Can this be a service? That would be dope. Maybe it's a Shortcut or script.
- Create extension for selecting an HTML hyperlinks. Then converting them to markdown (as a service).

## Improvements

- Magnet style window drag zones. I'd be able to stop using Magnet.
- I'd love more markdown hints
- There's this app that I've always wanted to build for podcast or lecture notetaking that has a timer and commits comments to times. I'd love to see that as a floaty note variant.

## Raw notes

**(These are just notes. I'd like this to be a guide)**

## Commands

<kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> - Open Raycast
<kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> - List options for command

### Basics

1. <kbd>ESC</kbd> navigate back one page
1. <kbd>‚åò ESC</kbd> navigate back to main page
1. <kbd>‚åò W</kbd> open preferences
1. <kbd>‚åò ,</kbd> open preferences

## Beginner features to adopt

## Tip: alias

Typing the alias, followed by a space, directly opens a Command, saving you an extra step

## 2024-01-20

## 2024-01-16

- [Create Quick Event](https://www.raycast.com/mblode/quick-event/commands). I Really like the native Quick Event environment. This simply brings it into Raycast
- [Navigator/Menu Item Search](https://www.raycast.com/changelog/1-20-0). I use help search all of the time. This makes it one less thing I need a mouse for.

## 2024-01-28

Unregister these commands to utilize <kbd>hyper + c</kbd>

- System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Text > - Convert Text to Simplified Chinese - Convert Text to Traditional Chinese

## Found notes for snippet creation

### Basics

To use snippets, you gotta create them first.

- Call up the `Create snippet` command
- Hit `enter` to open the command
- Give it a unique name
  - Spaces are ok
- Paste your snippet in
- And that's all that's required.

### Placeholders

- In this box you can change rich text formatting, add links, whatever
  - I don't personally care about that
- But to the right you can add `placeholders`
  - Click this `+` button to make your snippets dynamic
- Add a date, with one of the pre-selected options
  - Or use a custom date
- We can then place the cursor too!
  - Hit `+` again, and place this where you'd like to place the cursore
- You can also automatically include whatever's in your pasteboard

### Keyboard triggers

Keyboard triggers are great if you don't want to touch Raycast at all‚Ä¶

## Use Snippet

## Import Snippet

- https://manual.raycast.com/snippets/how-to-import-snippets
- It will avoid including duplicates, which means you can set up a snippets file, and re-import that every time you make changes
  - Just note that any time you change a name, that's going to
