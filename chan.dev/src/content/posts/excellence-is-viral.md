title: Excellence is viral
---

About 9 years ago I gave the best man toast at my brother-in-law's wedding.

I'm a decent speaker. And I did a good job.

But I didn't realize how good a job until hearing that brother-in-law deliver the toast at his brother's wedding.

It was the best groomsman toast I'd ever heard. Flawless.

Excellence begets excellence.

When you try hard, take your responsibilities seriously, you set a bar for others to beat. And when they exell, they don't just bless you with their achievement. They bless others.

Do the absolute best you can, in al things. It will come back to you.
