Storybook [doc blocks][] help you document and share UI components with generated **interface documentation**,
**interactive playgrounds**,
and **copy-pasteable source code**.

Let's take a look at **all** the [doc blocks][] _you_ can use to quickly document and share UI components.

Let's dive inâ€¦

## Prerequisite

[Doc blocks][] are used in custom [docs page templates][] and [MDX documentation][].  
If you're not familiar with those Storybook features, check out these 3 minute introduction videos.

## Setup

I'm working in a CSF file,
using a custom docs page template.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Button.stories.jsx
// Found in /examples after `npm storybook init`

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";

const meta = {
  title: "Example/Button",
  component: Button,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      page: () => (
        <>
          {/* ðŸ‘· WORKING HERE ðŸ‘· */}
        </>
      ),
    },
  },
};

export default meta;

export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    primary: true,
    label: "Button",
  },
};

export const Secondary: Story = {
  args: {
    label: "Button",
  },
};
```

## Generate documentation from source code

Let's start our component documentation with title and description.

First, import doc blocks from `@storybook/blocks` module.

```ts
import {} from '@storybook/blocks'
```

(I'll leave this import block empty â€”Â with the expectation that VS Code will import named exports as I use them.)

### Title

The [Title component][] renderes a styled `h1` tag.

Without props, it displays the auto-title or `title`, defined in component `meta`.
But it also accepts `children` if you want to override that default.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<!-- ```jsx
<Title />

{/* or */}

<Title>Override title</Title>
``` -->

![Alt text](./storybook-doc-blocks-for-component-documentation/title-component.png)

### Description

The [Description component][] renderes a styled `p` tag.

It displays the JSDoc comment, above the component declaration.
Earlier versions of `Description` took a `children` prop. But this option was deprecated in version 7.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
{/* Uses JSDoc comment description. */}

<Description />

{/* Use of `children` is deprecated in v7, and later. */}
```

### Subtitle

Finally, the [Subtitle component][] renders a styled `h2` tag.

Without props, it displays the component meta value `para$$meters.componentSubtitle`.
And it accepts `children`, for cust./om values.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
<Subtitle />

{/* or */}

<Subtitle>Something else</Subtitle>
```

<section class="hidden-video-script">

**Short #1:**

The Title, Description, and Subtitle components make it possible to keep written documentation in sync with component source code!

This isâ€¦  
_How_ to generate documentation from source code, in Storybook.

## Generate copy-pasteable examples and source code

Storbook isn't just a stickerbook of visual components.
You can display source code for every story.
This makes it easy for teammates to copy and paste exactly the code they need.

### Story

The [Story component][] (without props) displays your first story component directly into the document.

```jsx
<Story />
```

### Source

The [Source component][] to display a copy-pasteable snippet of the code used to produce that story.

```jsx
<Source />
```

### Canvas

The [Canvas component][] is like both `Story` and `Source` combined.
It wraps a story in a little box with a collapsable source code accordian.

```jsx
<Canvas />
```

### Pass components using the of prop

All the these story components take an `of` prop, where we can pass a story object.
In this file, we have a `Secondary` story.
So let's add Story, Source, and Canvas, for the `Secondary` story as well.

```diff lang="jsx"

- <Story />
- <Source />
- <Canvas />
+ <Story of={Secondary} />
+ <Source of={Secondary} />
+ <Canvas of={Secondary} />
```

Nice.

### `Stories`

It would be a real slog to update our docs page template every time we add or remove Stories.
So Storybook provides a [Stories component][] that renders all of your stories with title and description.

```jsx
<Stories />
```

<section class="hidden-video-script">

**Short #2:**

The Story, Source, and Canvas components give you three different ways to display your components in documentation.
_And_ they make it easy for others to copy and paste precise component source code into their projects.

## Genreate interactive documentation

:::hidden-script

**Short #3**

This isâ€¦  
_How_ to generate interactive documentation with Storybook.
:::

### `Primary`

And the [Primary component][] displays a full Storybook `Canvas`, with the addition of these zoom and re-render buttons.
And it does so for only the first Story in Storybook.

It's designed for use with interactive docs.

### `ArgTypes`

Table of component props generated by TypeScript and/or JSDoc comment
Learn more in (linked video)

### `Controls`

Like the ArgTypes table with an additional Control column
Where component args are set up, Controls update the Story components above.
Learn more about args and controls in (linked video)

## Display all stories

<section class="hidden-video-script">

**NO SHORT**

</section>

### `Stories`

The [stories component][] renders all the stories contained in a story module â€”Â showing off all of the known permutations of your component.
Each with the titles and descriptions of their stories.

## Conclusion

I hope that you're inspired to start communicating your components thru clear, interactive documentation, using Storybook and doc blocks.

The new reference docs on [storybook.js.org][] are incredible. They go into details far beyond what we can cover in quick tips like this.
