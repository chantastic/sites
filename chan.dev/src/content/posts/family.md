We didn't eat out much, growing up.  

But we had a regular tradition of closing out the year at Olive Garden
â€” "when you're here, you're family."  

We talked about our favorite moments of the year.
And I used 90% of my willpower to keep my chair in stationary.
(What other place puts casters on their furniture?)

We drank table half-n-half and convinced the wait staff to do the same.

It's the one place I felt allowed to be a kid.
Funny; there, we really were family.
