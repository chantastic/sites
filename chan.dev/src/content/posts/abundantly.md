> I came that they may have life and have it abundantly

The bible has a unique sympathy for the human condition.

For a book that's fundamental principle is the way of grace,
It demonstrates a deep understanding of humanism.  

Most spiritual works are about discovering, understanding, and ovecoming the human condition.
But in the bible, it's fully known, assumed, a pre-condition.  

It's not surprised when characters exercise it and live in it.
