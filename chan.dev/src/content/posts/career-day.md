# I'm a Designer

* Before I tell you what I do, what do you think a designer does?

# I'm a Designer for the internet

It means that I make decisions about the way websites look and behave.

# Who
  Michael Chan

# What
Designer (what's a designer?)

# Where?
Planning Center (what does planning center do?)

# When?
When I was your age, my job didn't exist. The internet was new to most normal families and there wasn't a market for the type of software i make now. In particular, mobile phones didn't even exist until i'd graduated college.

This is to say that the job you have at my age might not exist today. And if it does, it might look totally different than it does.

That isn't just for tech. My daughter Ruby has a rare disease that only effects 200 people a year. 20 years ago, they didn't even know what it was. 5 years ago they had only just learned how to treat it. Today there are people that dedicate their entire career to fighting her disease.

The career you chose might not exist today. And that's REALLY exciting.

What does that mean?

It means you need to invest in your interests.

For me that was drawing, music, technology, and teams.

I have notebooks full of drawings and ideas over the years.

I was in show choir in high-school, I studied music and studio recording in college, then i toured with a rock band, then i worked as a tech and worship team member at my church. I started making websites for friends.
