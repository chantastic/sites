i've always had a big challenge in the workplace.
i like being an IC. i much prefer it.
i love learning. i love tinkering. i love figuring something out.

but I _have_ to be able to trust that there's an adult in the room for me to really engage that sense of play, focus, and wonder.

and those people inevitably lose that.

and i don't know if it's me — subconciously releaving myself via a sense of moral duty. that's extremely possible. but i don't think so.
