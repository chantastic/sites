There's a handful of middle years where your resources are so thin.  

You're in your prime earning years.  
Which means you spend on the past, present, and future simultaniously.

If you're lucky, your spouse and kids taking more time, money, and attention than you'd ever spent before.

And, if you're unlucky, your parents get sick, radicalized, or emotionally dependant.

It all has to funnel thru this narrow path â€” every effort stealing resources from the others.  
And you feel so warn thin as to be fully transparent.
