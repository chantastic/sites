title: Better defaults for Screen Studio

Screen Studio is almost a really great tool.

But people take the defaults and their their videos don't just look like #ads for screen studio.  
They look like shit.

Wild-ass camera movements.  
Mouse effects before the interactions.  

They just look bad.

But they don't have to.

Here's how I use it capture great feature demonstration from teammates — by changing some of the bizarre defaults.

## Cursor

Cursor size
: `2x` to `2.5x`

Always use pointer cursor
: `enable`

Click effect
: `Circle`

Click sound
: `MX Master™`

Hide cursor if not moving
: `2.0s`

## Screen animation style

Post-record mouse smoothing is the greatest feature of Screen Studio.  
It makes it possible to look like you nailed you demo the first time.  
And best of all, it even eases mouse position across edits.

But the only usable option is `Rapid`.  
Other smoothing options are so slow that mouse interactions (hover, click, etc) appear to happen even befor the mouse arrives.  

It looks bad.

When recording I scrolling slowly over hoverable items and leaving a 1-second pause before clicking.  
This gives you the most reliable results in all modes.

Cursor animation style:
: `Rapid`
