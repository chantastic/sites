Let's make Storybook our own with a custom theme!

It's super easy, you just need a 7:3 aspect ratio logo, text editor, and a strong preference for light or dark mode.

Let's dive in.

## Initial setup

This tutorial requires uncommon setup.
So, let's get that out of the way.

- In the `.stoyrybook` directory, create a new `manager` module.
  - Import `addons` from "@storybook/manager-api"
  - And `themes` from "@storybook/theming"

```ts title="./storybook/manager.ts"
import {addons} from '@storybook/manager-api'
import {themes} from '@storybook/theming'
```

Add a 350x150 image to the `/public` directory. (Storybook 7 serves this directory by default.) I have a `350x150` .png with a transparent backgroup.

Now we're ready to set up a themes.

## Set persistant light or dark color scheme

Create a new config object using `addons.setConfig`.

Provide an object with a `theme` property and use one of the preconfigured themes. `themes.normal` is the default and respond's to the user's preferred color scheme.

```ts title="./storybook/manager.ts" ins={4-6}
import {addons} from '@storybook/manager-api'
import {themes} from '@storybook/theming'

addons.setConfig({
	theme: themes.normal,
})
```

However, you can set an explicit theme with options `light` or `dark`.
Ensuring that Storybook looks the same indifferent to user's system theme.

```ts title="./storybook/manager.ts" del={5} ins={6}
import {addons} from '@storybook/manager-api'
import {themes} from '@storybook/theming'

addons.setConfig({
	theme: themes.normal,
	theme: themes.light, // or themes.dark
})
```

## Setting up a custom theme with `create`

Now we're using a `light` theme but our our configuration options are limited.
Refactor this config object to allow for a custom image and colors.

- Import the `create` method from `@storybook/theming`.
- Replace `theme.light` with `create({ base: "light"})`

```ts title="./storybook/manager.ts" del={2,6} ins={3,7}
import {addons} from '@storybook/manager-api'
import {theme} from '@storybook/theming'
import {create} from '@storybook/theming'

addons.setConfig({
	theme: theme.light,
	theme: create({base: 'light'}),
})
```

These are functionally identical. But creating a theme opens more options. And the `base` option to override and extend theme values without having to specify _every_ value.

## Add brand image to Storybook

We all know that the most important part of any project is the logo!
Let's add ours using our custom theme

Add `brandTitle`, `brandUrl`, `brandImage`, and optional `brandTarget` properties to the theme object.

```ts title="./storybook/manager.ts" ins={5-7}
addons.setConfig({
  theme: create({
    base: "light"

    brandTitle: "My custom Storybook",
    brandUrl: "https://chan.dev",
    brandImage: "/chan-dev.png", // using publicly served /public directory
    brandTarget: '_self',
  }),
});
```

## Set brand colors and typography

With our theme in place, Storybook accepts a number of options for general theming.
Let's explore a few:

For a full list of theming values and options, check out the post listed in the description below.

```ts title="./storybook/manager.ts" ins={6-12}
addons.setConfig({
  theme: create({
    base: "light"
    /* FOLD: â€¦brand imageâ€¦ :FOLD */

    colorSecondary: "#ffcc00",
    appBg: "#f0f0f0",
    appBorderColor: "#ccc",
    appBorderRadius: 0,
    textColor: "#333",
    barTextColor: "#666",
    barSelectedColor: "pink",
  }),
});
```
