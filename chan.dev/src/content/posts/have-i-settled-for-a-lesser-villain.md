Heroes are defined by their villain. Have I settled for a lesser villain?

The interesting thing about the virtuous character is that they are inherantly on the defensive.
They are in a responsive position.
The villain really defines the game.
Heroes just have to be ready for it.

Now, in the real world, I donâ€™t believe in absolute heros and villains.
Only the relative percepition of each for the value of narrative.
