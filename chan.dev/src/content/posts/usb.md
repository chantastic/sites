Everything I know about cables after testing them.

## Charging

### Type-A

Every Type-A connector I tested registered 7.8 W or fewer when charging.

### Type-A to Type-C, or Lightning

I had a few cables that registered 13 W.
Definitely less common.

### Type-C (PD)

Most cables with Type-C connections regestered 30 W, even if they looked pretty cheap.  
But there were outliers that only registered 17 W.

### Type-C (PD), cable matters

Cables that I purchased intentionally for charging are the only ones capable of high-watt charging.

The [Extreme Flexible USB Charging model](https://amzn.to/475OdJS) achieved 60 W, as advertized.

My 100 W cable (now discontinued) also achived the advertized 100 W.

## Data

All cables were capable of the USB 2.0 standard 480Mbps transfer speed.

Those capable of more were notibly thicker (and sometimes ridgid).

Not all high-speed cables were marked.  
Brands really like to put their stupid logos on things instead.
Even so, they regularly had an elongated connectorâ€¦ but not always.

Moving forward, I'll prefer cables that state their rating on the connector.

## Takeaways

- [Thunderbolt 5](https://amzn.to/45HGbV0) and [Thunderbolt 4](https://amzn.to/475OdJS) cables are best as clearly marked and broadly capable. This [OWC Thunderbolt 4 cable](https://amzn.to/4mnInbn) is also well-regarded.
- Cable Matters makes charging cables in [flexible](https://amzn.to/4mIFSjE) and [braided](https://amzn.to/4mygVrx) styles with high wattage. But they only transfer data at 480Mbps
- Everything else is just kinda irritating.
