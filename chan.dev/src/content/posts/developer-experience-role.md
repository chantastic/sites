## About this job

As a Developer Educator, you’ll serve developers by inspiring and equipping them to build with LaunchDarkly through high-quality technical videos. The person in this role will own the vision, strategy, metrics, and execution behind our developer video content. Success requires shipping technical videos and owning the results of that content across platforms.

This role will also work across the company to enable others to produce high-quality videos in both short and long formats. Success here creates significant opportunity to build and scale a team of contractors and individual contributors as a team leader and manager.

## Responsibilities

- Own and drive the vision, strategy, metrics, and execution for developer video content. Our current Developer Relations team has hustled to produce some initial short video content, but we’re investing in long-form content as well. This role defines how LaunchDarkly serves developers through video. Our goal: get developers to the “aha!” moment quickly, then equip them to adopt increasingly advanced features of our platform.
- Write code that enables developers to succeed with LaunchDarkly. This code will be featured in videos and reused by others on the Developer Relations team for blog posts, talks, and other content.
- Work closely with Product teams to ensure developer videos showcase our products and that features provide a smooth developer experience.
- Mentor others on the Developer Relations and Developer Experience teams. We have strong raw talent that, with guidance, can grow into senior leaders—technically and in service of colleagues and customers.
- Decide how to scale video efforts. As initial successes stack up, expand output by managing contractors and individual contributors to create more high-quality video content.

## Qualifications

- Deep expertise in at least one programming language such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C#, or PHP.
- A track record of publicly available, high-quality technical videos you’ve created. This is most often demonstrated through an existing YouTube channel or similar portfolio.
- Firsthand knowledge of software development. Bonus: additional expertise in machine learning, AI, and/or DevOps.
- Self-starter attitude, empathetic, and motivated to serve developers while leveling up colleagues.

## Pay

Target pay ranges (Geographic Zones*) for Level P5:

- **Zone 1:** San Francisco Bay Area or New York City Metro (if not Bay Area–specific role): $195,000 – $251,900**
- **Zone 2:** Boston, DC, Irvine, LA, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Santa Rosa, Seattle: $175,000 – $225,500**
- **Zone 3:** All other US locations: $165,000 – $214,500**

LaunchDarkly operates from a place of high trust and transparency; we share pay ranges to align with your needs. Exact compensation varies based on skills, experience, and location.

Additional benefits include RSUs, health/vision/dental insurance, and mental health coverage.

## About LaunchDarkly

Modern software delivery was supposed to be the foundation for thriving digital businesses, but reality has proven otherwise. Slow development cycles, costly outages, and fragmented customer experiences prevent developers from building their best software.

The LaunchDarkly platform helps developers innovate on new features faster—while protecting them with a “safety valve” to instantly rewind when things go wrong. Developers can target product experiences to any customer segment and maximize business impact. By gradually rolling out new application components, they avoid nightmare “big bang” technology migrations.

The platform guides engineers to the next frontier of DevOps by:
- Improving release velocity and stability, without risking outages
- Delivering targeted experiences via personalized features for customer cohorts
- Maximizing business impact through experimentation and optimization
- Coordinating releases across platforms for consistent customer experiences
- Boosting engineering effectiveness with insights into cadence and stability

At LaunchDarkly, we believe in the power of teams. We’re building a group that is humble, open, collaborative, respectful, and kind. We’re an equal opportunity employer that values diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability.
