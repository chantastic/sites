i was raised under a weight of responsibility. i'm the first son in a chinese family, which means i was kinda raised with this notion that i would eat shit my entire life in support of the family.

people respond differently to that reality. i retreated.

i learned young to navigate life reflectively (reflexively?).

i imagine that most people go thur their life learning lessons and acreting a personality. for me it looked a little differently. i had proxies of personalities which i'd wrap myself in to fit different social situations.

there's a notion that goes around about a "people pleasing person." i know this type pretty well and i am _not_ that. but i do something similar. i reflect what i interpret my responsibility to be — in anticipation for what i believe the situation needs.

personality thru acretion:
. o O

personality thru adornment/reflection:
(who do i need to be to make this situation go smoothly?)
