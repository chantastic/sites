Boggle. It was my favorite game as a kid.

My family would play it for hours after the new year ball drop.

When I turned 10 was the firt time I was invited to the adult party.
And I thought "this is it. this is how great the rest√∏f my life is."

But I didn't know what I didn't know.
I didn't know if Boggle was the only thing my parents, siblings, and spouces could tolerate doing together.
I didn't know if the only reason my uncle played was to introduce me to new, mature words.
I didn't know who had just been elected president and who of my family voted which way.

I just knew I liked 1am Boggle.
