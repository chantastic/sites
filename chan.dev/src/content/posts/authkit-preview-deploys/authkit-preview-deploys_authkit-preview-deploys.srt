1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:00,933
Preview deploys from

2
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:03,100
companies like Vercel, Netlify,

3
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,733
CloudFlare, and more

4
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,833
make it easy for you to see

5
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:09,233
every commit in your Git tree

6
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:11,266
as a live production deploy.

7
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:12,866
But this can make things difficult

8
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:14,733
when integrating with other services

9
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,866
that require a redirect URI.

10
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,833
We have a lot of questions about this

11
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,833
from developers looking

12
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,566
to connect hosted AuthKit

13
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:23,166
in their preview deploys.

14
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,633
So today I'll show you a

15
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:25,933
quick and foolproof way

16
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:26,833
to connect with two.

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,033
Let's get into it.

18
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,666
On the screen I'm

19
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,866
running the local version

20
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:30,966
of my personal site.

21
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,933
And if I attempt to visit the dashboard,

22
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,633
I'll be redirected to my

23
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,833
hosted AuthKit login page.

24
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:37,966
If we investigate this URL,

25
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:40,500
we see a handful of query parameters,

26
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:41,966
including my client ID

27
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:44,399
as well as a redirect URI.

28
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,666
This URI is obviously encoded,

29
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,133
but if you look at it,

30
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,133
you can see that we're

31
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,600
sending users back to local host,

32
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,533
port 2426 slash auth slash callback

33
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:56,966
once they've been authenticated.

34
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,566
Of course, this is a known

35
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,566
value in my local environment,

36
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:02,533
but it's dynamic in a

37
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:03,533
preview deploy setting.

38
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,733
So let's go to Cloudflare

39
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,433
where this site is hosted,

40
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,666
find a preview URL and open it up.

41
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,533
Now, when I attempt to

42
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:12,733
visit the dashboard page

43
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,733
in this preview deploy, we get an error.

44
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:17,033
Now, what we need is a

45
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:18,733
way to get this dynamic URL

46
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,866
for this specific build into two places,

47
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,633
our sign in URL and

48
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:24,933
our WorkOS dashboard.

49
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,466
So let's copy it and

50
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,866
navigate to our work OS dashboard

51
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:31,966
where we will visit the redirects page.

52
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,166
Here we see our local

53
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,966
URL in our allow list.

54
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,099
So let's add our preview deploy.

55
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, preview deploys

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,933
follow some type of pattern.

57
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,233
This is the site and the domain.

58
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,233
And before that is the ID of the build.

59
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,533
This is the part that's

60
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,266
going to change most frequently.

61
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,333
So it will represent the

62
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,166
dynamic part with an asterisk,

63
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,033
which we can see is

64
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,733
used as a wildcard value.

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,366
Add that and we should be

66
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,966
good on the work OS side.

67
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,633
Now let's take a look at the code.

68
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,133
On our sign in page,

69
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,166
we are redirecting to an

70
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,000
authkit authorization URL,

71
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,833
which we get through our

72
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,866
authkit local library package.

73
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,966
So let's inspect that function.

74
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,533
The get authorization URL

75
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,366
requires three pieces of data,

76
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,333
the provider authkit, the

77
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,833
redirect URI and the client ID.

78
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,000
Now, because we want a

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,966
dynamic redirect URI,

80
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,933
I'm gonna cut this and

81
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,966
call an accessor function.

82
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,266
We'll then write a function that checks

83
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,966
if we even have a WorkOS

84
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,233
redirect URI in our environment,

85
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,666
return it if we do and

86
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,599
throw an error if we don't.

87
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,033
Now this is where it gets interesting.

88
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,066
In CloudFlare, we can

89
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,466
add a second condition

90
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,033
that will check for the

91
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,833
preview deployment URL.

92
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,666
In CloudFlare, that's cf_pages_url.

93
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,633
And in this case, render the preview URL

94
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,633
with our URI segments

95
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:48,800
attached to the end of it.

96
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,666
With this function in place,

97
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:51,300
we can now leave our work

98
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,866
OS redirect URI environment

99
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,866
variable undefined only in

100
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:57,233
our preview deploy environment

101
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:00,966
and depend on this cf_pages_url instead.

102
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,366
Let's say this commit and push.

103
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,666
Now back on our hosting platform,

104
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,066
we'll see this new build.

105
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,166
And once it's deployed,

106
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,033
we'll see a unique build URL.

107
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,366
This time when we try

108
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,666
to visit our dashboard

109
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,333
and get redirected to

110
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,266
authkit, we find success.

111
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,666
And finding our redirect URI parameter,

112
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:22,366
the proper dynamic preview deploy URL.

113
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:23,166
This means that we can

114
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,533
log in and be directed back

115
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,500
to this specific preview deploy.

116
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,233
So that's all you need to do to make sure

117
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,533
that hosted authkit is available

118
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,833
for all of your preview deploys.

119
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,599
If you found a particularly good article

120
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,766
on how to do this for

121
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:35,966
your specific platform,

122
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,766
please put them in the comments below.

123
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sure others would love to see them.

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,500
And if you have other

125
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
questions, we'd love to hear them

126
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
and help you get started with AuthKit.

127
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,366
I'm chantastic, I'll see

128
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:46,466
you in the next one, bye.
