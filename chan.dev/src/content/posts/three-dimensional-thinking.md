(don't remember what the context was for this. but it was definitely programming. And probably had to do with [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/))

found some more notes:

> humans suck at identifying, observing, and internalizing 3D problem solving
>
> a spreedaheet type approach to the third dimension

and now i remember, it was about building intentionally constrained systems to achieve understanding and simplicity.
