<small><em>

(a book idea. one of those books where parents have to say nice things about their kids. in this book, you enumerate annoying things your kid does and it with "...and i love you")

</em></small>

You smell like a taco bell exploded… and I love you.  
You never go to sleep without a fight… and I love you.
When I'm trying to have a quiet moment to myself, you keep interrupting… and I love you.
You choose the worst times to poop… and I love you.
You forgot my birthday again… and I love you.

etc.
