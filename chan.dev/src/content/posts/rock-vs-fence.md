Kids like to get themselves into circumstances they can't get out of.  
Which is great. Failure is the best teacher.

Rock spent 10 minutes freaking out at the top of our chain link fence, convinced that he could neither move forward or backward.  

I didn't help —
Not physically.  
I told him he'd be fine.  
A encouraged him while he sorted it out.  
But I didn't step in.

They say we lose empathy but grow in campassion as we get older.  
I know this was hard for him, learning to trust himself.  
To *decide* to move forward.  
And I'm glad I have a front seat to these discoveries.  
But his life — mistakes, successes, failures, and regrets — are his.  
And I want him to experience and own them fully.
