## [Star Noodle](https://www.starnoodle.co/)

Stellar experience.  
Dishes are delicous and thoughtful.  
Beautiful dining room, friendly staff, and great location.  
If we had one closer, I'd be a local favorite.

## [Kihie Food Oasis, at South Maui Gardens](https://www.southmauigardens.com/foodtrucks)

If you make just one food stop in Maui, this should be it.  
They have so many options and everything has a great island bent.

The location is beautiful, clean, and vibey.

We tried:

- [Thai Mee Up](https://www.southmauigardens.com/thaimeeup-kihei)
- [Wing Kings](https://www.southmauigardens.com/wingkings-maui)
- [Blig Bling Maui](https://www.southmauigardens.com/blingbing-shaveice)

Would go back to try the rest.
