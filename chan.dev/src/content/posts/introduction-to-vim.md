# Notes

- Everyone teaches Vim wrong
- The most unique part of Vim are selections
- Visual mode is how you learn selections
- Type <kbd>v</kbd>
- Use physical keys like arrows to make selection
  - Think of this like a (shift mode)
- Vim Motions like w, e, b, t, and f
- Text Objects like i", a(, ib

Take it further:

- Character-wise visual selection
- Line-wise visual selection
- Block-wise visual selection
