Before:

1. Choose the right video idea
1. Us Post (Community) tab to poll viewers
   - Thumbnails, content, etc
1. Make the title the filename
   - Main SEO Keywords should be first (or close to the beginning)

On upload:

1. Wait 24-48 hours before publishing
1. Link to _playlist video_ not just a video directly
1. Add relevent videos and docs in description
1. Activate _all_ monetization options (midrolls every 90-120 seconds)

On post:

1. Promote via Post tab
   - Thumbnail (Square)
   - Title (prefixed with `NEW UPLOAD: `)
   - Share link
1. Respond to comments right when the video posts
   - Let's people know this is when you are live
1. Generate an SEO-optimized based on transcript
   - The transcript should be generated by YouTube (during 24-48 cooldown window)
   - Timestamps can be hit or miss on channels
1. Add a pinned comment (highest chance of being seen and counts as engagement)
   - Important links
   - A joke
   - Important corrections
1. Watch your video on both _TV_ and _phone_
   - Review your experience on both and make changes

```
Create an optimized SEO description for the YouTube video transcript I pasted above titled: {title}. Make the description short, engaging, tell them what the video is about and what they can expect from it, and make sure it's SEO friendly to attract the right people to the video.
```
