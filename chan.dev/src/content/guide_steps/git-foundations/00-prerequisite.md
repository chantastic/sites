Before we start, check which Git is installed on your system.

Run this command to verify your git installation:

```sh title="Find system git version"
git --version
```

My local `git` version is `2.43.2`.  

```
git version 2.43.2
```

Follow [the official Git installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if your Git installation is significantly older (or you don't have git installed).

*I used the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [installation instructions for macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).*

```sh title="Install git with Homebrew package manager"
brew install git
```

With git installed and updated, we have all we need!
