title: Configure local git

This is recorded into commits.
_Necessary config._

```sh
git config --global user.name "Michael Chan"
```

```sh
git config --global user.email "hi@chan.dev"
```

## Where are these files

`~/.gitconfig`

I prefer `~/.config/git/config` because it's where most of my other program config is.
