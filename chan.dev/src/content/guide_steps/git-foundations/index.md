title: A Chantastic Guide to Git Foundations
---

Git is the language of software collaboration.

Contributors communicate through commits and pull requests.  
Humans communicate with computers through continuous intergation and deployment.  
And even companies communicate with cutsomers through reliable feature development and rollbacks.

In this gentle guide to git, you'll learn all of the commands that I use on a daily basis. Commands to build this site, collaborate on open software, support community.

You don't need to know anything about to learn. But even if you're a seasoned pro, you may walk away with a fresh perspective on what makes git great.

Welcome to my guide to git foundations.

## Video intro

The first job I took that used git, I accidentally force-pushed my WIP feature branch to production.

It was terrible. The lead dev on the project spent the rest of the day untangling the mess I'd made and history I'd erased.

So I committed to get good with git. And, in the years since, I have regularly been the person helping others get out of an accidental bind.

The challenge with git is that we learn just enough to get by.
But remain in this state of paralisis any time something comes up that's out of our confort zone.

This tutorial lay the foundation for success in git

But don't be fooled. It's not just for beginners.
Even after 15 years of daily git use, I learned a few new things preparing these tutorials.

No matter where you are in your git adventure, there's somtehing to learn here.

I'm chantastic. And this is my epic guide to everyday git.
