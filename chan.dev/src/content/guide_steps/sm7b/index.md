This mic is the standard.

Love it or hate it, it is the choice for content creators, podcasters, broadcasters and more.

It’s an extremely compromised mic. But its versatility more than compensates for it.

it looks good on camera. and not for any single reason but a lot of little reasons.

- integrated pop filter
- integrated (and internal) shock mount
- matte black color
- integrated cable routing

I wanted to hate this mic. With degrees in recording arts, I never understood why at-desk creators love this mic so much.

The SM 7B microphone is not a perfect mic. It is the most versatile and that’s because of its shock mount system. I’ve seen a lot of mics attempt to compete on one aspect of the microphone quality. Would in fact it is easy to beat the S7 on one met. The problem is beating it on all metrics background noise isolation signal aesthetic and vibration injection
