Don't overthink your first content/streaming setup.  
As you learn you're style, you'll learn what you do or don't like in your equipment.

Your first setup, needs to work reliably and give you the space to explore.

This is a $1500-ish setup that I would happily buy today. You don't need all of it, either. Buy in the order listed [below](#tldr).

## TL;DR

- [FiFine k688][] mic ($75), on a [FiFine LP boom arm][] ($50)
- [Canon R50 kit][] ($700) on a [raubay monitor top camera mount][] ($25)
  - [connected via usb-c](https://youtu.be/IbDG-xLVtT8?si=g1L-h65nYex3rS9U)
  - using [a dummy battery](https://amzn.to/49IdIP8) ($25)
- [Amaran 60D S][] light ($170), with [Apurture Light Dome SE][] diffuser ($100)
- [Nanlite PavoTube II 6C] ($90) for RGB and/or hair light

## The microphone

The [FiFine k688][] is an [Shure SM7B](https://amzn.to/3T3Ayvo) "clone" that gets you 80% of the sound and features at 1/6th the price.

Here's what I like:

- Insanely cheap
- Sounds good
- Included shock mount
- Included audio interface
- Accepts XLR, when you're ready to upgrade to a pro interface

Things I don't like but don't matter:

- Feels cheap
- Not heavy enough to be mounted on traditional boom arms

## The mic stand

Because the [FiFine k688][] is light, you need a boom that uses friction over tension. The [FiFine LP boom arm][] is great for the price.

There's no point in upgrading this if you want to shell out $500+ for an [O.C. White boom arm].

## The camera

The [Canon R50 kit][] is the best value I've found.

Things I like:

- 4k@30 recording, no crop
- Built-in webcam option (at 1080p), no capture card needed
  The kit lens is good enough, with a good zoom range
- Great image quality, out-of-the-box
- Reliable autofocus

Things I don't like:

- The USB-c can't power the device and charge it simultaneously. You have to use [a dummy battery](https://amzn.to/49IdIP8).

## The light

The [Amaran 60d S][] is a helluvah light. And more than you need for an interior seens. I run my keylight at 20%.

The [Apurture Light Dome SE][] is the most _compact_ softbox I've found with decent enough diffusion for desk work.

Your desk will determine how you end up standing up the light.
