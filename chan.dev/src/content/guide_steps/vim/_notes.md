title: 'I love Vim'

I love Vim.  
There's nothing quite like it.

The flush of efficient motions.  
The rush of nmumonic macros.  
My keyboard and I are one (body and mind).

Emacs is everything.
The one true editor.

I think and do with syncronicity.  
I can never go back.

My love is never ending.

```
esc: enter normal mode
gg: go to the first line of the document
o: open a new line below the cursor
(Insert the line `I love Vim`)
9G: got to line 8
(add missing `The`)
esc: enter normal mode
ci(: change inside (nearest) parethesis
(add text "body and mind")
d}: delete next paragraph
G: go to the last line of the document
A: append at the end of the line
```
