This course is about Vim motions.  
It is not about Vim itself, or any editor.

I've used Vim motions in TextMate, Sublime Text, Emacs, JetBrains, VS Code, and every cloud editor I've used.
Every vim emulator I've used is perfectly capable of covering the standard motions in this course.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions about which Vim emulator to use and what the tradeoffs may be.
