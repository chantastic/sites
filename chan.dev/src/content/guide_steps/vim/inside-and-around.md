## Take it further

If you'd like to see your selection before commiting to an action, you can substitute <kbd>c</kbd> for <kbd>v</kbd>.

<kbd>v</kbd> enters Visual mode.  
While commands like <kbd>c</kbd> typically take their motion as a postfix, Visual mode takes its motion as a prefix. Visual mode allows you to run the same motions (as a visual selection) and the postfix the command.

- <kbd>vi"</kbd>
  : Visually sellect inside (nearest double quotes).

- <kbd>c</kbd>
  : Change selection.
