title: 'A chantastic guide to vim motions (in any editor).'
---

You don't have to "learn vim" to edit code 100x faster.  
Nor do you have to switch editors to get the benefit of vim motions.

You can keep your editor.  
You can continue using the shortcuts you know.  
And you can sprinkle in the best of Vim: vim motions.

## Most vim tutorials are shit. This is different.

Most people teach Vim like they learned it in the 70s.  
They'll start with <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, and <kbd>l</kbd> and proclaim "look you don't have to use arrow keys anymore!"

Arrow keys are fine.

The theif of keyboard productivity isn't arrow keys;
It's moving to the mouse for text selection and file navigation.  

This guide is different.  

We'll cover only the most effort-eliminating motions â€”  
Simple Vim motions that will completely change the way you edit code.

And it takes just 5 lessons.

## About the author

I'm chantastic.

I'm not a fast developer.  
I'm not a fast thinker.  

So keyboard efficiency is something I needed to nail down early in my career.

Not only have they helped

I learned Vim motions for my first full-time coding job (in 2010).
And Vim emulation was the only real cross-flatform option.

I've taught Vim to thousands of happy, productive developers since.
