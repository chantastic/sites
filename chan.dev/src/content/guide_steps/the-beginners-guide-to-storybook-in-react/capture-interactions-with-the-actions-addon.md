[React specific]
[maybe use an example where I add `console.log` to the demo]

`console.log` just works, right?
It sure does, but we can do better in Storybook.

Let's use Storybook Actions to persistant `console.log` spies on our components.

- In component meta, add an `argTypes` object
- Add a `key` for the event prop you'd like to observe
- Finally, provide an object with the `action` string you'd like to log.

Now the Actions Addon Panel will log `onClick` actions!

```diff lang="js" title="src/components/Button.stories.js"
export default {
	component: Button,
+	argTypes: {onClick: {action: 'onClick fired'}},
}
```

(Note: you may see a different event prop, depending on the framework you're using. Just make sure that it matches the prop name.)

Let's add some actions to the `Page` component too…

[Open the source code]

The `Page` uses a number of `on{Events}`.

```diff lang="js" title="src/components/Page.stories.js"
export default {
	component: Button,
+	argTypes: {
+  onLogin: {action: 'onLogin fired'}
+  onLogout: {action: 'onLogout fired'}
+ },
}
```

Now there's one more action on this page: `onCreateAccount`.
You'll notice that we still see logged events, even though it's not in the `argTypes` object.
This is because the default install of Storybook comes with a catchall action for all events.

You can find it in `.storybook/preview.js`.
This is the root most configuration file and any `on` prefixed props will be caught by this.

Update this regex to change the default behavior,
or disable it entirely.

```diff lang="js" title=".storybook/preview.js"
const preview = {
	parameters: {
+		// actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
		controls: {
			matchers: {
				color: /(background|color)$/i,
				date: /Date$/i,
			},
		},
	},
}
```
