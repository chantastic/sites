[Demo the sample stories from another example]
Our sample stories came with this really cool documentation.
These must be really hard to implement, right?

Nope! It's just one line of config.

- Open the `Button` story file.
- Add a tags array to component meta.
- And add the tag `autodocs`.

```js
{
	tags: ['autodocs']
}
```

That's literally it.
And look at all this documentation we get!!

A playground.
Copy-pastable code.
Detailed interface documentation.

All with one line of code. This is the power of Storybook.
