title: Conditionally bundle apps with environment variables
slug: homebrew/conditional-dependencies
---

Brew bundle allows for conditional loading of dependencies, using environmental variables.

As an examples, I use different versions of node on my work and personal machines.

If want, I can always install the latest version of Node. But also install the LTS version on my work machine.

```sh file="Brewfile"
brew "node"
brew "node@20" if [[ $MACHINE != "work" ]]
```

To proc this, I need to set an environment variable when running the command:

```sh
MACHINE=work brew bundle
```

<!-- TODO: test this command -->

## Inverting the command with unless

The Brewfile DSL also offers an `unless` keyword.

This is identical to `!=` above.

Use `unless`, if you think natural language reads better than code.

```sh file="Brewfile"
cask "arc" unless [[ $MACHINE == "work" ]]
```

## Next steps

I have a strong opinions about how to manage machine-specific environment variables. See the appendix on environment variables in the paid material for details.
