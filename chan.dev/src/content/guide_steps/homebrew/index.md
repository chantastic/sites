Never setup another Mac.

In just three years, I've had to provision seven Macs.

I upgraded my personal mac, was laid off from one company, setup up an intermediate machine, then promptly joined aother company, to experience a corrupt drive two months in…

It's been an adventure.

Somewhere along the path, I got wise and learned how use Homebrew to provision a Mac with one line of code.

This guide will help you do the same.  
But it's not for everyone.

This isn't a Homebrew tutorial.  
I assume you have it setup and have already installed a package.

I assume that you're already using Homebrew to install packages. But you haven't explored advanced features for system provisioning.

Let's get into it.

i am done manually provisioning mac’s and it’s all thanks to homebrew.

if went thru a lot of macs last year.
- i broke a display
- bought a mac mini because i was sick of macbook keyboards
- returned my work macbook after being laid off
- bought a temporary laptop to get thru conference season
- and finally got a new laptop after joining work is

so i’ve provisioned a lot of machines for web work

and it got pretty old.

fortunately, i wasn’t stupid thru all of it and figured out a way to automate the whole thing with one line. apps, fonts, everything

today i’ll share that with you in A chantastic guide to provision mac’s with brew bundle
