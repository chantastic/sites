Never setup another Mac.

In just three years, I've had to provision seven Macs.

I upgraded my personal mac, was laid off from one company, setup up an intermediate machine, then promptly joined aother company, to experience a corrupt drive two months inâ€¦

It's been an adventure.

Somewhere along the path, I got wise and learned how use Homebrew to provision a Mac with one line of code.

This guide will help you do the same.  
But it's not for everyone.

This isn't a Homebrew tutorial.  
I assume you have it setup and have already installed a package.

I assume that you're already using Homebrew to install packages. But you haven't explored advanced features for system provisioning.

Let's get into it.
