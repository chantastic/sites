Homebrew has command that will export a manifest of brew-installed packages.

```sh
brew bundle dump
```

The result is a `Brewfile` that looks like this:

```sh title="~/Brewfile"
tap "buo/cask-upgrade"
tap "candid82/brew"
tap "homebrew/bundle"
tap "homebrew/services"
brew "mas"
brew "neovim"
brew "node"
brew "node@20"
cask "font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font"
cask "visual-studio-code"
vscode "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
vscode "supermaven.supermaven"
```

<!-- TODO: add mas to example -->

The `Brewfile` is created in the directory where you run the command.  
But you can specify both file name and path with the `--file="~/some/path/my-brewfile"` option.

```sh
brew bundle dump --file="~/some/path/my-brewfile""
```

_Note that `brew bundle` commansd assume the file name `Brewfile`. So customizing the file name will required that all commands include the `--file` option, indifferent to file system location._

Congratulations.  
You now have a manifest of installed software on your system.
