title: Bundling from Brewfiles
slug: homebrew/bundling-from-brewfiles

If you've used the default name of `Brewfile`, you can run the `brew bundle` command in that directory.

```sh
brew bundle
```

And if you want to bundle from a specific file, use the `--file` flag.

```sh
brew bundle --file=~/.dotfiles/Brewfile
```
