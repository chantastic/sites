- sweetalert2 refactor
  - Make it a module that exports config, not a class. classes are a bad boundary for extensability. bad if your app doesn't own the implementation
  - Provide all CSS fallback values as static CSS — not CSS Variable defaults — for IE11 support in Church Center
  - Don't use `system` values, let apps map those. This leaves the apps in control and doesn't interduce an interdpendency on @planningcenter/system. The lib should remain focused on simply supplying defaults and extension points for sweetalert2
  - Don't introduce  a new API. When we leave it unopionated, we keep the entire breadth of documentation and features available to teams using it
  - With the current system, am I able to chain .then() onto the promises? Or is that not returned to me?
