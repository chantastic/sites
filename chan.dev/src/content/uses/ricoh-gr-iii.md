The RICOH GR III is my favorite.  
High praise for a camera that's always broken.

Small with a big sensor,  
rich — film-simulated — jpegs,  
ND-equipped,  
the RICOH GR III is a pocket-sized photo powerhouse.

And it bests iPhone at time-to-picture —  
out-of-pocket and up-to-face in a second.

## Contents

## History

The RICOH has been our family snapshot camera since November 2019.

I bought it to fill the spiritual void left by my Yashika T4 —  
a 35mm film camera that became to expensive to shoot.

The RICOH delivers.

## The magic

RICOH's Positive Film simulation (slightly under exposed),  
produces supple, velvety images with toasty skin tones.

My Kodak Gold addled brain loves these warm tones.

The look leans heavy toward 80's Miami beach —  
bikinis, mustaches, cigarettes, and candy-apple Ferraris.

## Ergonomics

Unlike an interchangeable lens camera,  
the RICOH is designed to be shot with one hand.

Every control is under your right thumb or index finger —
making the camera feel more bionic-limb than electronic.

## The suck

Like all greats, the RICOH is deeply flawed.

The spinning dial on the back is trash.  
Every review includes the same complaint:  
"The dial broke after a month."

I spent the time and money to have mine replaced.  
It broke again.  
I gave up.

This isn't a deal-breaker because menus remain navigable via touch (clumsily) and the (slower) exposure center-detent control.

But it's a shame that the camera becames clumsier over time (and less one-hand operable).

## How it can be improved

- More robust controls
- Phase-detect autofocus
- Crop compose modes (40mm)
- Passable video _(even 1080p@30, with a decent bitrate would be fine)_

## Recipe

- Positive Film
- ISO 400-800 (ideal grain)
- Under expose

## 5-year vibe

I still love this camera.

But I'm reaching for video more frequently.  
It's what my kids enjoy and want to rewatch.

I'm using [OK Video](https://okvideo.app).
