The Sony a7 IV is what I use to produce all of my YouTube [@chantastic](https://www.youtube.com/@chantastic) and [@chromaticui](https://www.youtube.com/@chromaticui).

## 1-year vibe

Sony cameras are a mixed bag.  
I think that their color still sucks and their UI ergonomics are terrible.

But the a7 IV — specfically — as a a problem solver camera.

- 4k recording for both full frame and aps-c crops
- In-camera 10-bit, 4:2:2 recording quality
- Multi Interface Shoe equiped (for use with XLR mics)

## Overall

This is a work camera.

Unlike my [GR III](/uses/ricoh-gr-iii), which produces beatuful .jpgs, right out of camera, every time… sony requires you to work for it.

I don't reach for this camera if I'm not doing work. The ergonomics are uninspiring. The out-of-camera colors are terrible. And most of the available lenses have this terrible clinical look.

## Add physical presets

The a7 IV has 3 physical presets.
The can be used to contain a variety of configurations.

- Shooting mode
- Focus mode
- White balance
- Aperture, ISO, shutter speed
- And recording/encoding settings
  To set them:
- Enter `M`aunal mode
- Make make changes
- Navigate to `Shooting > Shooting Mode > Camera Set. Memory`
  - From here select the physical preset (`1`, `2`, `3`)
  - (There are additionally some `M`-prefixed settings that can be stored and manually recalled inside of `M`anual mode)
    Because I switch resolution (and encoding modes) between Streaming and Recording, this really useful.
