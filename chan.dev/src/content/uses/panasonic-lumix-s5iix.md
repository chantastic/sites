## Why I like this camera

## Output lag and compensation

The S5II\* suffers very bad output lag.

Lag improves when HDMI audio is disabled.
But at it's worst, video trails audio by 5-7 frames (on an average audio interface).

And it get's wierdâ€¦
Using the same hardware (with different software) requires slightly different offsets.

These offsets work for me, with both camera and microphone going thru RodeX Streamer X.

| Software   | Feature name | Offset                   |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Ecamm Live | Mic Delay    | +5 frames (167ms @30fps) |
| OBS        | Sync offset  | +7 frames (233ms @30fps) |
