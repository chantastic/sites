I learn slowly.

On this vacation,  
I got sunburnt twice.

Vacation-jeopardizing, hydration watch sunburns that sidelined me for days.

This is normal for me.  
For as long as I remember,  
I've taken twice as long to learn anything.

That used to make me feel dumb.  
It doesn't anymore.  
Now I read it as having twice as much tenacity.

Failure doesn't freak me out.  
It shouldn't freak you out either.
Failures are life's learning receipts.

Often, a colossal failure is just shy of a huge success.  
Your instincts might have been correct but execution off.  
Fail again.  
Fail better.

Eat your pride.  
Don't let your fragile ego jump to conclusions and miss a real lesson.  
Keep making the mistake until you discover exactly which factor is off.  
Then change it.  
That factor won't be what you assumed.

For me?
UVs are off the charts in Hawaii.  
I should be reapplying twice as often as at home.

Live and learn.

P.S.
Have you given up too soon on something you believe in?  
Feel like it deserves a second chance?  
Hit reply. I'd love to chat with you about it.
