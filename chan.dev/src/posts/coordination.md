I outed myself as a choir kid on [Chats with Kent](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/03/episodes/michael-chan-teaches-you-how-to-break-into-the-industry) this month

With nervous honesty, I confessed that my favorite human achievement is coordination and that I've never experienced it in software development.

Choir, orchestra, The Rolling Stones, Beyoncé's Single Ladies, a Destiny fire team where players lead, follow, partner, and sacrifice themselves at in unity...

I love teams for their ability to hit harder, go farther, and be more than an individual  
But that more requires humility, partnership, and trust

I made a big mistake in my transition to software development.
I overestimated the software engineer's natural ability to coordinate.
I underestimated the their ability to identify the sabotage of self-interest and I overestimated the technical manager's ability to coach away outbursts of unhelpful self-expression.

As someone who believes in team,  
I thought coordination was something engineers just needed to see more of to understand.
But I was wrong; I don't think it's in the archetype.
And I'm wondering if it's time for something new.
