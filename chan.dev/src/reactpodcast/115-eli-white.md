title: "115: Eli White on Principles and React Native"
---

## Summary

### Be opinionated

Principles and positions gives others the opportunity to quickly align and collaborate, or disagree and move on. It'll save a ton effort in the long game of product development

### Be a generalist

Organize work around features and products, not platforms

### Design for local alignment

No user gives a shit about "cross-platform consistency". They want an experience that is locally consistent with other apps on the platform they use
