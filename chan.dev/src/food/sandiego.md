I've lived in North County San Diego my entire aware life.  
If you're visiting, welcome! These are my favorite places to eat and their best dishes.

This is — by no means — an exhaustive list of San Diego's greatest food. But it's good fucking list.

## [Dija Mara](https://dijamara.com)

Dija is about as far away from Oceanside as you can get in Oceanside. You walk thrue the door onto a different continent. We go here when we want to escape to a place where folks aren't afraid of heat and fish heads.

### Favorite dishes

- Grilled Roti
- Charred Eggplant
- Pork Belly Skewers
- Mie Goreng
- Nasi Goreng
- Whole Friend Market Fish
- Coconut Ice Cream Brownie (retired)

### Favorite drinks

- Beets by Bali
- PALOMA #808

## [The Friendly](https://www.instagram.com/thefriendlysd/)

This is the best burger in San Diego, full stop.

One reviewer on Yelp said "this burger looks like it was run over by a truck". That's right. The burger looks like shit. But holy balls it's a bite of pure soul.

### Favorite dishes

- OG Dirty Flat Top

## [Tribute Pizza](https://www.tributepizza.com)

I love the Costo Combo. It's non-ironically one of my favirote pizzas. Hit me with an artisinal, wood-fired, classic combo tribute — in an abandoned postal service building and I'm so in I can't find my way out.

Everything about this place is perfect.

### Favorite dishes

- the classic combo supreme
- house made award winning sea salt foccaccia with marinated garlic confit, balls of burrata, housemade 'nduja'

## [Underbelly Ramen](https://godblessunderbelly.com)

This is "white people asian food" my grandmother warned me about — I won't dance around that. But shit, if it's not the best "white people" ramen out there. And if you like lots of tastes and cocktails, they crush it.

### Favorite dishes

- Belly of the beast bowl
- Chicken confit bowl
- Kimchi
- Crispy chicken wings
- Pork belly bao

## [East Village](https://dineeastvillage.com)

- Kimchi-chive Street-Cart Pancakes
- Carnitas Dynamite Fries
- Monk's Stone Pot

## [Tajima](https://tajimasandiego.com/tajima-convoy/)

Between the Mexico border and an Asian college town, carnitas ramen is a unique cultural mish-mash that is odd and delicious.

### Favorite dishes

- Carnitas Ramen

## [Tasty Noodle House](https://www.tastynoodlehouse.us/san-diego)

My brothers discovered this place after my dad passed. But if we'd discovered it while he was still living, he would have wanted to die eating there. This is the hole-in-the-wall, pot-sticker-slinging, bun-filling, cash-discounting, noodle shop of his dreams.

My grandma likes it; `nough said.

### Favorite dishes

- Shanghai Grilled Pork Bun
- Shanghai Xiao Long Bao w/Pork
- Spicy Seseme Pork Wonton
- Braised Prok & Tofu Skin in Soy Sauce
- Taiwanese Chicken

## [Prager Brothers Artizan Bread](https://www.pragerbrothers.com/)

The Prager Brothers make the best bread on planet earth. By brother moved to NYC this last year and said the only thing he misses is Prager Brother bread.

### Favorite dishes

- Epi Baguette
- Shortbread Cookie
- Spicy Italian Sandwich
- Seeded Baguette

## [Lofty Coffee](https://loftycoffee.com/pages/roasting-works)

Lofty Coffeee Roasting Works in Encinitas is the most special places to enjoy a hot drink in North County.

They roast really wonderful coffees but this seems to be the only one of their locations where they know how to brew it. But
