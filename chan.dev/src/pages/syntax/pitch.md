Hey, I had such a blast in our chats and got totally nerd-sniped by the thing you're creating.

I made this doc, mostly while walking to and from the (so please excuse its crudeness). But it's my pitch for the first quarter of working with a video creator.

## Summary

[Reinforce](#reinforce). [Connect](#connect). [Create](#create).

## Reinforce

Reinforce the addition of the podcasts with platform-specific capabilities: YouTube cards (dynamic but disruptive).

This helps distinguish video as a unique (higher fidelity) Syntax. experience.

We add short-form, vertical videos for max re-distrubution. And include a callout to the related episode: “Learn more about {X} at syntax.fm/{#}

These are a few candidates I pulled from the latest episode, that could use visual/educational reinforcement.

## Connect

Connect the dots between video, social, and website.

Explore a cooperative workflow, where high-priority videos are identified (before video podcast release).

See if we can record and insert video right into the video podcast, [VH1 Pop-up video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Up_Video) style.
This is something that people loved in [Storybook's Storytime interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxwDAMQGa0g&list=PLw6GJy26kmCIaRN1oVXNA8eBlWjP7N5Q_) series.

Unlike the cards approach, [above](#reinforce), this is completely non-disruptive to core content.

We could create some topical landing pages on the Syntax. website. `/orm`, `/react`, `/node`, etc. They could showcase all of the episodes with that as a topic. And eventually grow to include chnannel learning resources ([See: Create](#create)).

## Create

Create new formats that establish the channel a broader education resource. Start with topics that were disproportionately popular on the podcast.

After my chat with Ben, I started thinking about higher effort, more exhaustive, more durable, non-podcast formats for channel uploads. I think this would provide a broader counter-point to news-driven formats.

There are two formats that might do well here. This is the shape they could take for the latest episode (if the response justified additional content):

- `The Syntax Guide to SQL: The 20 commands, operators, and features you HAVE to know.`
  - Style: freecodecamp YouTube (guide)
  - Question: how?
- `A Brief History of ORMs: How they came to be and why they are still relevant.`
  - Documentary style.
  - Question: why?

"What", "when", and "where" are well covered by the podcast.

This could tie in really well to the topic pages mentioned in [the connect section](#connect).

## Notes

Transcripting seems to prefer "Century" not "Sentry" 😅
