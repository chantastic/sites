It's my favorite cinematic transformation...

Ringo hands over the Bad Mother Fucker wallet, drained of cash

Jules — held at gunpoint by his own demands — unravels the mystery of the cold-blooded murder monologue he shouted at the beginning of the film

> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is The Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

It's a passage from the 1970s movie Karate Kiba — which Jules attributes to Ezekial 25:17

He shares his interpretation and how he justifies himself as the righteous man but — in his reflection — takes a sharp turn

"...I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth."

I depend on my permanent status as the hero
I read myself into stories as the righteous man or charitable shepherd
And I see my enemies as the selfish or the tyranny of evil men

I'd like that
But that shit ain't the truth

"The truth is [...] I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm trying, Ringo. I'm trying real hard to be the shepherd."
