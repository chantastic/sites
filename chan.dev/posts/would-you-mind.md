"Would you mind opening the door?" — asks a walking box

"Yeah. I mean, no... Yes, I will open the door and no, I don't mind doing it" — I stammer back an a panic as the box waddles past — indifferent to my struggle

I hate negative confirmation questions
I feel like it creates two jobs:

1. Open the door
2. Solve this verbal riddle

Who's happy with this?
I'm not
The walking box doesn't seem bothered

I can't deal
So I say obnoxious shit like "could I trouble you to hold the door?" — which feels like an assault of unnecessary politeness
But folks know how to answer concisely
And I like that

What's something you do that's shrouded in awkward intentionality?
