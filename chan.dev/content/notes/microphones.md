# Microphones (WIP)

Let me tell you which microphones to start with .

I own over 20 microphones  
So I have strong and nuanced opinions  
I know that isn't helpful when you're starting your podcast or livestream,  
So I've limited it to four

I've chosen these four on their ability to build up to the next system

I haven't been able to finish the detail sections of my recommendation  
So, if you don't trust me, you'll have to wait

## COVID CAVEAT

Many of these items have limited stock or prices have been inflated  
I've added B&H product links because they provide stock notifications

## For \$60: Samson Q2u

Buy at: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2LlQjtX), [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/598772-REG/Samson_SAQ2UPK_Q2U_Handheld_Dynamic_Microphone.html)

### Why it works

- It sounds good
- It rejects background sounds really well
- It inludes all the accessories you need to start
- It supports USB so you don't need additional hardware
- It supports XLR so you can upgrade it with a better interface

### Meh

- It's not a great looking mic
- You'll outgrow the included accessories pretty quickly

### Suitable and similar alternatives

- [Audio-Technica AT2005USB](AT2005USB)
- [Audio-Technica AT2100x-USB](https://amzn.to/3dsCcz0)

I used the AT2100USB to record the 2016-2018 episodes of [Bird Call Review](http://birdcallreview.com)  
The two mics above are newer versions of that mic

These are very similar to the Samson Q2u but don't include the same useful accessories  
They also sound "thinner" to my ears and they have a blinding, blue "on" LED

But, pretty close if you can't find stock of the Samson Q2u

### Why this works

- USB plug-n-play but "upgradeable" to
- Beginner accessories included
- Better isolation from background sounds that popular USB mics (Blue Yeti, et al.)

### Why you might need to upgrade

- Multi-personal, local recording
- Need better source files (24-bit vs 16-bit)
- Electro-magnetic interferance from nearby monitor

No  
Those are for interfaces with worse preamps

This doc is a work in progress  
The recommendations aren't likely to change any time soon  
But I'll flesh out the decision-making nuances a bit
