Do better

Not because I just said so
Not because it'll might make someone in your life happier

Do better for you

If The Bible is true — and I think it is —
God gave humans two things: work and relationship

And we fucked it up trying to get more knowledge

Do your work
Not your job — your work

Find the thing you know deep down in the pit of your stomach is work that only you can breath into the world
Do it every day
Do it better every day

And high-five your friends when they do the same
