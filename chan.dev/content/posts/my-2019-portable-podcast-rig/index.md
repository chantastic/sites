title: My 2019 Portable Podcast Rig
date: 2019-10-21

Just packed my portable podcast rig for the first time this year.  
It's changed a lot and I thought I'd fill interested nerds in on the updates.

## Case

![Case](2019-podcast-rig_case.png)

When I bought my [Zoom H6 Portable Recorder](https://amzn.to/35V2sPF), a [Gator Titan Series case](https://amzn.to/2MTTOba) was included as a promo.  
I've since sold the H6 but kept the case because it's great.  
I removed the insert and it holds everything that I need for 1:1 interview.

I like this case because it fits easily inside one half of my carry-on sized rolling bag.

## Recorder

![Recorder](2019-podcast-rig_recorder.png)

I use the [Sound Devices MixPre](https://amzn.to/2P4gFDP) as my portable recorder.  
It's also the recorder I use for my remote interviews.
It's my favorite piece of electronic equipment.

I upgraded because I needed a better backup system for remote interviews.  
The SoundDevices — when used as a desktop interface — allows me to record an isolated backup of the guest track.  
This has saved many episodes that might have been otherwise lost.

As a portable system, it's not markedly more impressive than the [Zoom H6](https://amzn.to/35V2sPF) I used last year — when paired with [the right mic](#microphones).  
And I still recommend it for most.  
It's a great portable recorder for the price.

## Microphones

![Microphones](2019-podcast-rig_microphones.png)

I travel with two [Rode M2](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/643205-REG/Rode_M2_M2_Professional_Condenser_Handheld.html) handheld condeser microphones.

I also use this mic for my side of [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com) episodes [Egghead videos](https://egghead.io/instructors/michael-chan).

These mics handle non-ideal situations better than any other I've used.

The [Rode M2](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/643205-REG/Rode_M2_M2_Professional_Condenser_Handheld.html) has a tight hyper-cardiod polar pattern — which is very good at supressing background noise.  
And it's a condensor — which means it's pretty easy for all recorders to drive without noise.  
The built-in windscreen is also pretty good.

Don't buy this mic from Amazon.  
They aren't a trusted reseller.  
So you won't get support from Rode.  
I bought mine from [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/643205-REG/Rode_M2_M2_Professional_Condenser_Handheld.html).

### Backup and Alternative Microphones

I also bring a pair of the impressively cheap, [Pyle-Pro PDMIC58](https://amzn.to/2P7QWKw) microphones as a backup.  
Or as additional mics for more people.

These are a great sub-\$20 starter mics.  
You can hear them on [Episode 52 of React Podcast with Sophia Shoemaker].

For just a few bucks more, pickup the [Behringer Ultravoice Xm8500](https://amzn.to/31B65XA).  
I wasn't aware of this mic when I got my cheap backups.  
If I had been, I'd have bought it over the Pyle Pro.

Of course you can use the versitility winner — [Samson Q2U](https://amzn.to/35Ubr3p) — with this setup.  
A mic that can be used directly with USB.

## Accessories

A list of all teh accessories I use

### Windscreen

I use [these cheap windscreens](https://www.amazon.com/Mudder-Cover-Handheld-Microphone-Windscreen/dp/B019OO4IY6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3QSCB56EWOF0V&keywords=sm58+windscreen&qid=1571696498&sprefix=sm58+%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-3) to cut down on wind and reduce plosives.  
They work exceptionally well — even up close — if I pull them an inch off of the grill of the microphone.

Again, what I use for my side of React Podcast.

### Stand

These [foldable tabletop stands by ammoon](https://amzn.to/2BwevF1) are great for travel.

They take up very little space and are wicked stable.

I use the [Audio-Technica AT8415 Microphone Shock Mount](https://amzn.to/2J7i08T) because it's small, effective, and the rubberbands are easily replaced.

### Cable

Thes [tiny XLR cables by Cable Matters](https://amzn.to/2oRR5aA) are great for travel and have been reliable for me.  
Bring at least one backup.

## Battery

![battery](2019-podcast-rig_battery.png)

I use the [Sound Devices MX-LMount Battery Sled](https://amzn.to/2qwhWct) and [RAVPower NPF5500 batteries](https://www.amazon.com/NP-F550-RAVPower-Battery-CCD-SC55-Replacement/dp/B0761SH551/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ravpower+l-series&qid=1571695955&sr=8-1).

I like the LMount sled because it mounts two batteries.  
If one fails during a recording, there's a backup.

I like the RAVPower batteries because the charger uses USB — which I always have wall adapters for.

As an alternative — or additional backup — I can use my [Anker PowerCore+ 20100](https://amzn.to/2MABTrp) notebook battery bank as a power source.

So I'll get a tiny little bit of money if you click on a link and then buy something.  
The Rode M2 links to B&H because Amazan is not an approved retailer.
